# Delve

Delve is a powerful, extensible platform for ingesting, transforming, and searching structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. It is designed for easy local development, robust production deployments, and seamless integration with modern tools and containerization workflows.

## Features
- Ingest data from diverse sources (REST API, file tail, syslog, scheduled queries)
- Transform and normalize data with custom pipelines
- Perform powerful search and filtering with a pipeline syntax
- Create interactive dashboards and visualizations
- Set up alerts and notifications
- Extend functionality with custom apps and commands

## Project Structure
- `manage.py` at the repository root for standard Django management
- Core apps (e.g., `events`, `users`) and configuration in top-level folders
- `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` for Python dependencies
- `bootstrap.py` for automated build, packaging, and asset management
- `frontend/` for JavaScript and SCSS assets
- `docs/` for user and admin documentation, published via MkDocs and GitHub Pages
- `utilities/cli/` for ingestion utilities such as `tail-files.py` and `syslog-receiver.py`

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McIndi/delve
cd delve
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
```


### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. Run database migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Install frontend dependencies and build assets
```bash
npm install
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

### 6. Collect static files
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### 7. Create a superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Start the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 9. (Optional) Start additional services
```bash
# Task scheduler
python manage.py qcluster

# Syslog server
python utilities/cli/syslog-receiver.py

# Tail log files
python utilities/cli/tail-files.py /var/log/*.log
```

> **Defaults:** Delve ships with Whitenoise + CherryPy by default to keep air-gapped/offline use simple. Swap components as desired.
## Dependency Management

All Python runtime dependencies are managed via a single, pinned `requirements.txt` at the repository root. Do not add runtime dependencies to `pyproject.toml` or use `pip install .` or `pip install -e .`. For local development, Docker, and ZIP/air-gapped workflows, always install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to update dependencies, edit `requirements.txt` directly.


## Database Creation in Docker Compose

When you set `DELVE_DATABASE_NAME`, `DELVE_DATABASE_USER`, and `DELVE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` in your `.env`, the Postgres container automatically creates the database and user with those credentials on first startup. No manual setup is required.

## Using Delve with Docker Compose

Delve ships with a `docker-compose.yaml` for easy setup. Make sure to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (see comments in the file).

### Build and Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the images and start the web server, worker, and Postgres database.

### Run Database Migrations (required after first start)
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a Superuser (for admin access)
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### View Logs for All Services
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Restart All Services
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Stop and Remove All Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Docker Troubleshooting & Cleanup
- If a service fails to start, check logs with `docker-compose logs <service>`
- If environment variables are missing, Compose will error out with a message (for required secrets and DB credentials)
- To rebuild images after changing the Dockerfile, use `docker-compose build`

#### Inspect Docker State
- List all containers (running and stopped):
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
- List all images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- List all volumes:
  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```
- Show disk usage (images, containers, volumes, build cache):
  ```bash
  docker system df
  ```

#### Clean Docker Environment (remove all containers, images, volumes, caches)
- Remove stopped containers:
  ```bash
  docker container prune -f
  ```
- Remove unused images:
  ```bash
  docker image prune -a -f
  ```
- Remove unused volumes:
  ```bash
  docker volume prune -f
  ```
- Remove everything (containers, images, volumes, networks, build cache):
  ```bash
  docker system prune -a -f
  ```

## Advanced: Automated Build & Packaging For Air-Gapped Systems

You can use `bootstrap.py` to automate building, packaging, and asset management for deployment to air-gapped systems. While containerization is also supported, this utility enables deployment to air-gapped environments without requiring dependencies on the target system.

After running the following commands, you will have a zip file under `./dist/` containing everything needed to deploy Delve to an air-gapped system, including source code, Python interpreter, frontend and backend dependencies, and more:

- Clean build artefacts:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py clean --all
  ```
- Download and extract Python:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py download_python
  python bootstrap.py extract_python
  ```
- Install Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py run_pip_install
  ```
- Install frontend dependencies and build assets:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py run_npm_install
  python bootstrap.py build_frontend
  ```
- Collect static files:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py collectstatic
  ```
- Package everything:
  ```bash
  python bootstrap.py package
  ```

Or run all steps in sequence:
```bash
python bootstrap.py all
```

See the [Bootstrap Guide](docs/admin/Bootstrap_Guide.md) for full details and extensibility options.

- **Ingestion:** Multiple methods, including REST, file tail, and syslog
- **Field Extraction:** Index-time and search-time extraction
- **Custom Apps:** Extend Delve with new commands, dashboards, and APIs
- **Alerts:** Search-based and processor-based alerting
